Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Ilyas Mouhssin, and I am a bug bounty hunter. I specialize in finding vulnerabilities in web applications and reporting them to the respective organizations. My passion for cybersecurity and ethical hacking has led me to explore various platforms where I can contribute by identifying security issues and helping make the internet a safer place. Through this journey, Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience in different security testing tools and techniques.

Apart from bug bounty hunting, I am continuously expanding my knowledge in the field of cybersecurity, learning new methodologies, and staying updated with the latest trends and threats. I aim to keep growing as a security professional and contribute to the cybersecurity community.

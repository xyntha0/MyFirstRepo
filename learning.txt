What I have learned from this course  
In this course, I learned how to create and manage my first GitHub repository. I created a repository called MyFirstRepo, added an introduction file, and committed my first changes. I also explored branching by creating a feature-update branch where I added my personal and academic goals. Later, I learned how to collaborate using forks and pull requests by contributing to another repository. Finally, I practiced cloning a repository locally and pushing updates from my machine back to GitHub. These steps have helped me understand the basic workflow of using Git and GitHub in real-world development.
